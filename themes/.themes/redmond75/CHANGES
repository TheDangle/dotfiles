v1.57
~~~~~
1) Added option to set default icon set in theme templates.

v1.56
~~~~~
1) Cleaned up theme file comments for clarification of functions.
2) New dark theme. (Numidium)

v1.55
~~~~~
1) Added slightly customized variant of Obsidian icon theme.
2) index.theme: Cursor size set to 16/32 between Normal/HiDPI variants. Also set Obsidian-Sand as default icon set. Moot if running an xsetting daemon.


v1.53
~~~~~
1) Once again, reverted to unscaled GTK2 as scaling it causes breakage with any combination of font/element scaling for Qt.
   Since I only use a handful of GTK2 applications at this point, it works better for me, but the scaled assets are still
   present in the themes and can be invoked in some environments. See README.md for more details.
2) Modified theme templates/builder script to allow different modes for handling GTK2 assets.


v1.50
~~~~~
1) Reverted to the upscaled GTK2 theme as default in HiDPI themes: Icons are still too small in GTK2 (And Qt) but window geometry
   should be sane. I think function over form is a better choice. Also got rid of the gtk2-scale script since it isn't needed now.
2) Fixed typo in GTK3 settings.ini
3) Set font sizes in Metacity theme, though it seems to do nothing on my setup, with or without xfsettingsd running.
4) Adjusted Spin boxes in GTK4: Now a 1:1 match for GTK3.


v1.42
~~~~~
1) Redesigned themes to use normal scaled GTK2 assets/rc files by default (This fixes Qt theming), but with the scaled up variant
   also included beside it. An included script under the "extra" folder called gtk2-scale can use this data to load GTK2 applications
   to mostly scale properly on high resolution displays... on certain desktop environments... By default, Xfce4's xfsettingsd
   component will override the flags it invokes, leaving GTK2 applications tiny on a 4K display.
2) Defined button order on CSD windows. Again, this doesn't work on Xfce4 by default: See README for a workaround.


v1.40
~~~~~
1) Split GTK4's gtk.css into separate, logical files like the GTK3 theme does.
2) Fixed a bug with incorrect name data in index.theme.
3) Misc typographical cleanups.
4) Fully HiDPI variants of themes. GTK2 was scaled 2x as much as possible for both window/object geometry and PNG assets.
   It still needs work but GTK3 and GTK4 appear to look fine using Xfce4's 2x Windows scaler. 
5) Added missing graphics definitions for Mixed Mode checkboxes and radio buttons in GTK2 theme.


v1.30
~~~~~
1) Completely rebuilt GTK4 schema and GTK3's CSD styling.
2) Fixed sizes for all combobox states.
3) Fixed all remaining CSD theming quirks.
3) Added HiDPI Xfwm4 themes with all elements integer scaled 2x.

v1.15
~~~~~
1) Further, massive, GTK4 improvements: It should be mostly complete and bug free now.
2) Muted the whites in Jet and Dusk.
3) Added remainder of Windows 95 Plus! themes and a few from Windows 98 SE.

1.14
~~~~
Improved GTK4 support.

1.13
~~~~
1) Fixed bug originally present in Redmond97 that caused constant events to be logged to ~/.xsession-errors
2) Improved GTK4 popover separators and proper CSD window outlines without a compositor being enabled.
3) Fixed some bugs with Whisker menu support.
4) Extended theme generator config file format to allow defined font for Whisker menu side bar logo, if applicable.

1.12
~~~~
1) Fixed title colors for Metacity in all themes/configs.
2) Color for title button glyphs now configurable.
3) Minor fix for exported Wine reg files.
4) New default theme for builder script ("Ouroboros").

v1.0
~~~~
Initial release.
